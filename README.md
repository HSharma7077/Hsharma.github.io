        <p>
          I am a PhD candidate in Economics at ESCP Business School in Berlin, working as a Research Assistant at the Chair of International Economics.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research interests lie in behavioral and experimental economics, public policy,
          and electricity markets. I am particularly interested in how individuals and firms
          respond to incentives in complex, real-world environments. In my PhD, I plan to
          conduct field experiments in India to study these questions in applied policy and
          energy-market settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current research agenda includes two working papers and two additional projects,
          including one using NFL performance data and another on housing markets and noise
          pollution. These build on my experience as a research assistant working on
          behavioral economics, housing economics, and historical finance at ESCP Berlin, as
          well as prior research roles at the University of Cologne and the Max Planck
          Institute. I hold an M.Sc. in Economics (Research Track) from the University of
          Cologne and a B.Sc. in Economics (Honours) from Doon University.
