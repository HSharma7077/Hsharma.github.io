  <p>
    I am a PhD candidate in Economics at ESCP Business School in Berlin. My work sits at
    the intersection of behavioural and experimental economics. I am particularly interested in how individuals and
    firms respond to incentives in complex real-world environments, and I plan
    to conduct field experiments to study these questions in applied
    policy and energy-market settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before starting my PhD, I completed an M.Sc. in Economics (Research Track)
    at the University of Cologne. During my studies in Cologne, I was supported by a PhD
    scholarship from the Chair of Macroeconomics and worked as a research
    assistant on projects in labour, behavioural, and macroeconomics. I have
    also collaborated with colleagues at the Max Planck Institute, the German
    Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS), and the Annual Status of
    Education Report (ASER) initiative, gaining experience with large-scale
    survey work and field-based research.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current research agenda includes two working papers and two additional
    projects, including one using NFL performance data and another on housing
    markets and noise pollution. Across these projects, I use experimental and
    applied microeconomic methods to study how policy design and institutional
    details shape behaviour, with a particular focus on energy and
    infrastructure sectors.
