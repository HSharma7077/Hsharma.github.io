  <p>
    I am a PhD candidate in Economics at <a href="https://escp.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESCP Business School</a> in Berlin. My research sits at
    the intersection of behavioural and experimental economics, focusing on how people respond to incentives when real-world conditions, such as limited trust, imperfect information, or unreliable infrastructure shape decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    A central strand of my research focuses on electricity markets. I study how households respond to incentives and information in applied policy environments, using experimental and applied microeconomic methods to generate evidence that can inform real-world policy design and implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use experimental and applied microeconomic methods, drawing on field experiments, choice experiments, and empirical analysis of survey and administrative data. I also work on projects in housing markets (environmental noise and prices) and performance-oriented environments where event-level data provide detailed measurement of behavior and outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hold an M.Sc. in Economics (Research Track) from the 
    <a href="https://www.uni-koeln.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Cologne</a>. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research assistant on projects in labour, behavioural, and macroeconomics, and collaborated with colleagues at the <a href="https://www.coll.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Planck Institute</a>, the
<a href="https://www.idos-research.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS)</a>, and the
<a href="https://asercentre.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)</a> initiative, gaining experience with large-scale
survey work and field-based research.
